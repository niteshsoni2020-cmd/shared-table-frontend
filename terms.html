                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">1. The Platform Role</h2>
                <p>The Shared Table Story ("The Platform") acts solely as a connector between Hosts (locals) and Guests (travellers). We do not own, operate, or control the experiences offered. We are not a restaurant, catering service, or tour operator.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">2. Host Autonomy & Responsibility</h2>
                <p>Hosts are independent individuals. They set their own prices, schedules, and menus. Hosts are solely responsible for ensuring their home environment is safe and that food is prepared with care. The Platform does not inspect private kitchens.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">3. Guest Acknowledgement</h2>
                <p>By booking an experience, you acknowledge that you are entering a private home. You agree to respect the Host’s property and culture. You are responsible for disclosing any allergies prior to booking.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">4. Cancellations & Refunds</h2>
                <p>Hosts define their availability. Standard policy: Cancellations made 48 hours before the event are eligible for a full refund. Cancellations within 48 hours are non-refundable to protect the Host's preparation costs.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, The Shared Table Story is not liable for any illness, injury, or dispute arising from an experience. Users engage with one another at their own risk.</p>
